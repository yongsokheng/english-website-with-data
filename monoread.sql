Tourists coming to the town make it a point to visit this zoo in their pass time. There are various things to do in Siem Reap and a visit to the Angkor Zoo, Siem Reap is one among that. The Angkor Zoo, Siem Reap is located off a dirt road on the way to Angkor. It is located just past the ticket gates off of Charles De Gaulle Blvd. This is a fairly small zoo that houses a great variety of birds and reptiles. There are over 100 species of animals and birds in this zoo. One of the main highlights of this zoo are the bears and the cheetahs.<br />\r\nThe Angkor Zoo is situated 5 km from Provincial Town and takes around 10 minutes to reach to the location. It is located on the turn off just past the admission entrance to the temples on the right hand side about 1 kilometer down the road. If you do not wish to walk to the Zoo, you can take tuk-tuk to reach this place. Unfortunately the zoo has gone pretty much to ruins and is not very well maintained. If you wish, you can donate some money for the maintenance of the zoo.Porcupines to some extent always present a problem. They are expert excavators and cages often need solid cement floors to prevent their escape. We have already built many very large enclosures for other species and had the option of placing them in these. Both groups of porcupines from Angkor are now in our two spacious, forested serow enclosures, one group in each.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/1/content_teuk-chhou-zoo-elephant.jpg\" /><br />\r\nOne pair traveled down with their two very tiny babies perfect miniature replicas of the adults.

Despite their years of captivity in their hot, dusty cages at Angkor Zoo, they have reverted to a nocturnal way of life and we seldom see them. We now have porcupines at PTWRC sharing cages with the following animals: serow, peafowl, gibbons, muntjac, and civets. We do this out of necessity as we do not have the money to provide individual cages for each species and have to use resources wisely. We believe that this is also an appropriate and ecologically responsible way to allow animals to interact as they would in the wild, as long as there is no chance of them harming one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By:<span style=\"font-size:12px;\"> MONOREAD</span></p>\r\n','CIMG0354.JPG',102,'','published','2015-11-24 00:05:54',NULL,NULL,3,3,'2015-11-24 00:05:54','2016-02-25 04:10:13'),(3,'Van Mieu doctoral steles recognised as national treasure','<p>A collection of 82 doctoral laureate steles at Hanoi&rsquo;s Van Mieu - Temple of Literature, which was the country&rsquo;s first university, has been recognised as national treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A ceremony to announce the recognition was held by the Hanoi Department of Culture and Sports on November 23.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 82 stone steles are carved with the names of those who passed royal doctoral examinations between 1484 and 1780 under the Early Le, Mac and Late Le dynasties.<br />\r\nThe stone slabs are placed on the backs of stone tortoises, which symbolise longevity and permanence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey can be considered as a unique sculptural work reflecting a great value of sculpture throughout the history of Vietnam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach composition engraved on the steles is highly regarded for its remarkable literature valuable in terms of art and ideology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe steles were recognised by UNESCO as a world documentary heritage in the Asia-Pacific region in March 2010 and on a global scale in July 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHead of the department To Van Dong said that the recognition is an honour to Hanoi.

Of course, you can survive and just not to pay attention to your neighbor, spend less time indoors, or avoid meeting him or her at home by learning your neighbor&rsquo;s schedule by heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#39;t be your own enemy.&nbsp;Survive! Let everybody think that you are fond of the job you are performing by showing maximum initiative and creativity, when completing assignments you receive. Do little things to make the day more enjoyable, such as listening to music while you work.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be yourself.&nbsp;However, if you are a direct person, try to smile more to your colleagues and think 5 times before you snap back. Nobody likes unhappy people and will not like to listen to your problems or come to your office just to see your serious and gloomy face.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Look on the bright side.&nbsp;Try to put together a list of positive sides of your job, company, employer, and staff. While doing so, keep your mind focused on positive; remember some funny stories that have happened to you recently. This will help to concentrate your thoughts and make them positive.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make something up.&nbsp;If you failed to find any positive sides, you could try to use your imagination in full and make up some positive things or even act to make changes. For instance, take one negative thing - a constant bad smell in the office. You could interpret this fact in your head, as, &quot;It does smell bad. But I&#39;ll buy those little funny smell improvers and hang them all over the place and encourage people to open windows more often.&rdquo; And after all the actions are implemented, you will feel like a hero, who has just saved the planet and therefore you&#39;d come to realize what a silly thing it&#39;d have been to have left such a comfortable place like the one you have just created.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember your salary.&nbsp;Whenever you feel like crying, find a calculator, and work out the salary, which you will receive soon and think of shopping, visiting, going to the theatre or dancing.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Take quick breaks to do what you enjoy.&nbsp;Find a task you will enjoy doing (or if not a task - an online magazine or newspaper you have always enjoyed reading). In addition, whenever you have a bad mood, or something wrong has again occurred to you at work - just keep yourself busy with what you enjoy. This is how you could distract and focus on spelling, vocabulary and other more enjoyable or enriching things.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn to laugh.&nbsp;Imagine your colleagues in funny situations (this works with bosses), and laugh at it when you are alone remembering about them. Laughing will make you happier.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be proactive.&nbsp;If you are asked to complete an unwanted task, suggest an alternative way. If it is not approved, act like you were instructed. At the end, everything will happen as you had warned. Just keep this case in mind and wait for the next stupid task to follow. When it arrives, remind politely about the previous case.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Take advantage of breaks.&nbsp;Try to go out for a lunch break, so you would feel the freedom, breathe the fresh air, and stay for a couple of minutes away from the working place.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make friends.&nbsp;Find people you can at least talk to, or ask for advice in the organization, but do it with utmost care having all your wits about you. This does help a lot, when you need support and understanding. If the place is not so perfect, there will be many people supporting you because they have already gone through the same. However, do not rely on them and filter what you say in public. To be on the safe side, be a bit vague, so you will always find a way out.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Look for another job.&nbsp;Just spend your time filling in application forms and sending out CVs. This will improve your mood greatly by distracting you and giving you something to look forward to and by increasing your chances of finding a better job.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be always 100% beautiful.&nbsp;Put on stylish clothes and spare some of your morning time for make-up and a perfect hairdo. A person makes a place, not a place makes a person.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider the job and place as a challenge and try to make a competition with yourself.&nbsp;How long will I be able to stay here? Mark a date on your calendar, when you will leave, if nothing changes. After all, you will be able to see if you are strong enough to overcome the difficulties.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Leave.&nbsp;If the money you get at this place is not the only source of income in your family, if you feel the job is no good for you and you will not reach your personal and career goals being employed by the company, look for another job and leave. You can also leave straight away. Nevertheless, be sensible; there might be some money involved whether you do things one way or another.

Make sure you actually speak to the interviewer&nbsp;when calling by phone; if you get their voicemail, leave a message only requesting they return your call at their&nbsp;earliest convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.Let the interviewer know that you are very interested in the job, but that you have a &quot;conflict&quot;and need to reschedule.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, the interviewer is not as personally invested in you as you may think theyare, and they won&#39;t inquire about what the conflict is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/16/content_business.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.If you are asked for an explanation, be as brief and vague as possible. </strong>The more detail you givea lie, the harder it is to remember and the more like a lie it sounds.<br />\r\nIf you have a conflict because of your current job, explain that a mandatory meeting, training, etc. wasscheduled and you are required to attend. As much as you would love to discuss opportunities, you have an obligation&nbsp;to be a professional. Chances are they will appreciate your work ethic and understand the need to reschedule.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.Unless you have officially accepted another offer</strong>,&nbsp;reschedule the interview, hopefully for a week&nbsp;later or more to give yourself time to settle things with the job you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you finalize everything with the job you want,&nbsp;</strong>call the interviewer and tell them you sincerely,appreciate their time and consideration, but have accepted another opportunity elsewhere. You do not need to&nbsp;give specifics or get into detail with the interviewer if asked; keep it short and simple.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By: Monoread Team</p>\r\n','interview.jpg',133,'','published','2015-11-25 02:25:12',NULL,NULL,2,3,'2015-11-25 02:25:12','2016-02-25 16:21:00'),(11,'Enjoy HD Video with Canon XF200 HD','<p>The&nbsp;Canon XF200 HD Camcorder&nbsp;is a compact, ergonomically friendly camera that is suitable for traditional multi-camera productions as well as ENG/event style coverage, independent and documentary filmmaking. The camera features a 1/2.84&quot; CMOS sensor that captures 1920 x 1080 video at various frame rates up to 59.94p, including a 24p mode for a more cinematic feel. The integrated Canon 20x HD Optical zoom lens has a 35mm equivalent zoom range of 26.8 to 576mm and features an 8-bladed iris to render highlights in a more natural manner. Individual gear rings for focus, zoom, and iris on the lens itself provide you a natural way to make manual adjustments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe camera records MPEG-2 at frame rates of 23.98/29.97p and 59.94i at up to 50Mbps, with 4:2:2 color sampling, to integrated CF card slots using an MXF wrapper that is compatible with most popular NLE systems.

The sensor features approximately 5% more pixels than 1920 x 1080 and records a 1920 x 1080 window from the slightly large sensor. This allows the camera to use the extra pixels for Electronic Image Stabilization and maintain the 1920 x 1080 resolution so the image isn&#39;t degraded by being blown up as with traditional EIS systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20x Optical Zoom Lens</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Canon 20x HD Zoom Lens provides a zoom range with 35mm equivalent of 26.8mm-576mm and a minimum object distance of just 23.6 inches (60cm). The lens features an eight blade iris design providing out of focus highlights with a natural rounded appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lens features three infinitely rotating rings for focus, zoom, and iris. The rings use an electronic coupling to move the lens functions but maintains a mechanically linked feel during use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Image Stabilization</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The XF200 offers optical image stabilization (OIS) useful for reducing image blur in a wide variety of shooting situations.

If the job description is too vague,&nbsp;it will fail to attract the right caliber of candidates. Also, careful attention should be paid for the job<br />\r\ntitle,keeping&nbsp;it simple is better so use something which describes the role i.e. &#39;Cleaner&#39; rather than &#39;hygiene technician&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. &nbsp;Select the interviewing team properly</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A set of experienced employers should be involved in the interviewing and decision making however it can also help to involve the people who will actually be working with the selected candidate. Current employees who serve in a similar or the same position will be able to relate to the candidate and encouraging them to make decisions on&nbsp;his/her compatibility will help them to feel more motivated and involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. &nbsp;Prepare fully for the interview</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proper interview style should be determined here and the relevant criteria and questions should be prepared ahead&nbsp;of time. Vital aspects such as the interview structure and good communication are essential at this stage to avoid discrimination. The interview questions should be based on the job requirements and should not discriminate on grounds of sex or race. See our interviewing article for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. &nbsp;Conduct a professional interview</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many interview strategies are available. The 70/30 rule should apply here. You should try to ensure that the candidate talks during 70% of the interview and the interviewer talks for only 30% of the time. See our interviewing&nbsp;guide for a detailed explanation of how to properly conduct a competency based interview.<br />\r\n<strong>5. &nbsp;Fully explain the job</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should the candidates idea of the job not match the reality of what the job actually involves, it is highly likely that&nbsp;they will leave soon after being employed. This is a disaster because it means you have to begin the entire recruitment process again. Be careful to fully explain the job to the candidates during the interview and check to see if they have understood. Remember interviewing is not just about selecting excellent people, it&#39;s also about making sure those people really want to do the job.<br />\r\n<strong>6. &nbsp;Communicate often</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you are communicative with all applicants throughout the process. Feedback should be given as soon&nbsp;as possible. Inform the candidates who are selected as well as those who have not been successful. Recognise that when someone applies for a job with you they are also often forming their first impression of interacting with your company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. &nbsp;Select a wide pool of shortlisted candidates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be wary of shortlisting too harshly and only ending up with only one or two candidates to interview. Provided you&nbsp;have implemented a broad advertising campaign (click here to learn how), you should always have at least three candidates for the final interview. This will make sure that if you lose your top candidate, you will always have&nbsp;another two or more who are also good choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. &nbsp;Undertake a structured induction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having selected the best candidate, you should give him/her a detailed induction to give them enough information to become productive. Do not expect new starters to immediately become good performers, on average it will take 90 days for them to become fully effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. &nbsp;Start on a probation period</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The employee should be given the chance to start the work under a probation period. This will help the line manager to further test the skills and the talents expressed by the employee at interview and will give both parties an easy way out should the new hire fail to deliver in the expected way. Probation periods vary in&nbsp;length but are usually around 6 months. You may want to start employees on a slightly lower rate of pay or hold off giving full employee benefits until they have passed their probation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. &nbsp;Follow up</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the employee has accepted the position, follow up promptly with the required paperwork (contracts,&nbsp;forms etc). When following up, it&#39;s important to make sure that any potentially contentious issues are discussed during the last stage interviews so that there are no unexpected surprises for the candidate. Salary, probation periods, benefits etc, should all have been discussed throughout the recruitment process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By: Monoread</p>\r\n','banner1-.jpg',115,'','published','2015-11-25 07:23:44',NULL,NULL,2,3,'2015-11-25 07:23:45','2016-02-25 04:10:12'),(14,'Find out about Cambodian national dishes','<p>Food gives us the energy for everything we do - walking, talking, working, playing, reading, and even thinking and breathing.

This religious literary work, dating from about ad 4, is known in various versions throughout India and Southeast Asia. In Cambodia, the story has been set to music and dance and performed by the Royal Ballet since the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the epic is also known in the villages, where it is translated orally or dramatized in the popular shadow puppet theater, the ballet was traditionally a courtly art performed in the palace or for princely festivals. The music of the ballet is performed by the Pinpeat orchestra, which is made up of traditional xylophones, metallophones, horizontal gongs, drums, and cymbals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/25/content_1.png\" /> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khmer classical dance derived from Indian court dance, which traces its origins to the apsaras of Hindu mythology, heavenly female nymphs who were born to dance for the gods. The traditions of Thailand and Java (in Indonesia) also influenced the music and dance of Cambodia. In classical Cambodian dance, women, dressed in brightly colored costumes with elaborate headdresses, perform slow, graceful movements accompanied by a percussive ensemble known as the Pin Peat. Pinpeat orchestras include drums, gongs, and bamboo xylophones.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Cambodia&#39;s villages, plays performed by actors wearing masks are popular.

Princess Buppha Devi, who currently serves as the Minister of Culture, is a master of Apsara dancing, which dates to the 1st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graceful movements of the Apsara dancers, adorned with gold headdresses and silken tunics and skirts, are carved on the walls of many of the temples at Angkor. Estimates are that there were 3,000 Apsara dancers in the 12th-century court of King Jayavarman VII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the centuries, Khmer dancing lent its influence to the classical ballet of neighboring countries, and some of its postures and movements are similar to other Southeast Asian dance forms. But according to Princess Buppha Devi, &quot;The Khmer kingdom started its traditions in the 8th century, 500 years before Thailand.&quot; In 1400, with the sacking of the Angkor Empire, the Apsara dancers were seized and taken to Thailand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apsara dancing is one of two elements of classical ballet, the other being &quot;today&quot; dancing, the depiction of early myths. Many of the dances involve performing a fragment of the Ramayana, the ancient Indian epic that is one and a half times as long as the Odyssey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others are based on the legendary battles and mythical sagas carved in bas-relief on the walls of the temples of Angkor-including the Churning of the Sea of Milk, the great battle between gods and demons for the holy liquid that gives immortality.

Keep reading to find out how to prepare, practice, and deliver a successful job interview introduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review your application materials.&nbsp;Reread your cover letter and resume to remind yourself of what you have already foregrounded on paper.

To develop your introduction and figure out what you should include, ask yourself some questions. Who are you? Why do you want to work for this company? What skills and professional experiences do you have that qualify you to work here? What do you hope to accomplish in your career? Write out your answers to these questions and use them to help craft your introduction.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You might start with something like, &quot;I recently graduated from ____ with a degree in ____&quot; If you have any honors, slip those into this opening line as well.

Choose something that fits who you are. For example, if you love to read you might start by saying that you identify with a famous literary character and then explain why by listing your skills. Or if you are extremely tech savvy and want to highlight that aspect of your skill set, you might begin by mentioning what comes up when you Google yourself and use then provide more details about yourself and your skill set.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write out your introduction.&nbsp;To make sure that you will remember all of your key points, turn your notes into a paragraph long (3-5 sentences) introduction. Write your introduction out exactly how you plan to say it. Start by providing basic details about yourself (who are you?), then move into details about your professional skills and experiences, and then finish by briefly stating your major career goals.

You might not be certain of how to act,&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nwhat to ask, etc. Here are some suggestions for the first-time interviewer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Be Professional:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You represent the company and you&#39;re likely the sole representative the candidate will see.&nbsp;Being&nbsp;professional means dressing the part,being respectful of the interviewee, and knowing how to act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon&#39;t be overly friendly&nbsp;or casual. Remember, it&#39;s your job to evaluate the candidate. Talking too much&nbsp;is common when we&#39;re&nbsp;nervous so try to stay calm and relaxed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Be Confident:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interviewee should have absolutely no idea that you are doing your first job interview. Have all&nbsp;your&nbsp;questions prepared and cleared with your supervisor. You must be aware which questions youcan and can&#39;t ask legally.Take notes. It might seem clear in your mind, but after you&#39;ve seen half adozen candidates, you might have a hard time remembering who&#39;s who. When a candidate arrives,&nbsp;shake his or her hand, invite them to take a seat, and make sure you stay in control of the coversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Know What to Look For:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will find out what type of person the interviewee is by his or her answers, and also by&nbsp;how they act,&nbsp;how they reply, and how they listen. Pay attention to small details. Are they&nbsp;listening when you speak? Do they ask intelligent questions? Are they interested in the&nbsp;position and&nbsp;not just the salary? Knowing what&nbsp;to look for is as important as asking the rightquestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Ask Useful Questions:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask questions that you genuinely want to know the answer to. Again, make sure they&#39;ve&nbsp;been cleared with&nbsp;the HR department and are legally all right to ask. Asking questions to&nbsp;trick interviewers is disrespectful. If&nbsp;you want to know if they&#39;re a team player, if they have&nbsp;good social skills&nbsp;if they are hard working, if they are willing to go above and beyond, ask&nbsp;them through intelligently-worded open-ended questions. And listen to the answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Some great questions are:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- What skills do you think this position requires and do you have them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- How would you describe your management style?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- What would you say you bring to a workplace?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Elaborate of the work you did at ABC company. How did it help your career?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Do Informal Tests:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a candidate says they are biligual and you speak the other language, switch to that&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nlanguage and ask them a few questions to evaluate&nbsp;their comprehension, level of language&nbsp;skills, and their proficiency to formulate sentences.If they state that they are able to do something<br />\r\nor have a specific skill, ask them instances to show you how&nbsp;they&#39;ve used their skill in the past.<br />\r\nAsk them for detailed examples of their abilities.<br />\r\nBeing prepared and knowing what to ask and look for will give you the answers you are seeking<br />\r\nwhen you are&nbsp;evaluating candidates. Try to&nbsp;look at the big picture for the type of employee you are&nbsp;looking for and whether the candidate in front of you is a good fit for your company. Project a postive&nbsp;image, friendly but professional,and remember to relax and be confident.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By: Monoread</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','b5.jpg',117,'','published','2015-11-26 22:34:50',NULL,NULL,2,3,'2015-11-26 22:34:50','2016-02-25 06:24:16'),(19,'Cabriolets exposed luxurious Mercedes-Benz SL 2017','<p>Mercedes-Benz has released the first image of SL 2017 SL 2017 standard version is equipped with a grille expanded diamond shaped, LED headlight shape inspired Mercedes-AMG GT supercar and makes and improved front with large air cavities.

Halong Bay</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Halong Bay&nbsp;is situated in north Vietnam round a 120km-long coast line and is literally translated as &ldquo;Bay of Descending Dragons&rdquo;. The top tourist attraction in Vietnam, Halong Bay features thousands of islands, each topped with thick jungle vegetation, forming a spectacular seascape of limestone pillars. Several of the islands are hollow, with enormous caves, others islands include lakes and some support floating villages of fishermen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Thien Mu Pagoda (Hue)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With seven stories, the&nbsp;Thien Mu Pagoda&nbsp;in Hue is the tallest pagoda in Vietnam. The pagoda overlooks the Perfume River and is regarded as the unofficial symbol of the former imperial capital. The temple was built in 1601 during the rule of the Nguyễn Lords. The initial temple was very simply constructed, but over time it was redeveloped and expanded with more intricate features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/30/content_33665510_057d57b216_b.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Hoan Kiem Lake (Hanoi)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located in the historical heart of Hanoi,&nbsp;Hoan Kiem Lake&nbsp;is one of the major scenic spots in the city and serves as the locals&rsquo; favourite leisure spot. Hoan Kiem means &ldquo;returned sword&rdquo;, and the name comes from a legend in which King Le Loi was given a magical sword by the gods, which he used to drive out the invading Chinese. Later he returned the sword to the Golden Turtle God in the lake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Hoi An</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fishing-village-turned tourist attraction is situated on the coast of the East Sea.&nbsp;Hoi An&nbsp;has been an international port from the 16th century although the serious shipping business has long since moved to the city of Da Nang. The heart of the city is still the Old Town, full of winding lanes and Chinese-styled shops. It is sometimes called the &ldquo;Venice of Vietnam&rdquo; because of the narrow canals that cut through part of the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Phu Quoc Island</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located in front of the Cambodia coast, Phu Quoc is the largest island in Vietnam. Phu Quoc is what Phuket would be if it hadn&rsquo;t been overrun by development. The island features pristine tropical forests, undamaged coral reefs and great beaches. One of its beaches, named Bai Dai (Long Beach), was chosen by the ABC News as one of five beautiful and clean beaches. Phu Quoc is famous for producing the best nuoc mam or fermented fish sauce in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/31/content_Phuquoc-Island-Coco.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6.

Mui Ne</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The formerly little-inhabited beach south of the fishing village of Mui Ne has seen some serious development in the last 15 years. Due to strong sea breezes it is a popular destination in Vietnam for kite and windsurfing. No trip to Mui Ne is complete without a trip to the famous sand dunes located a short distance north of the town. The vast sandy expanse provide some great panoramic views especially during sunset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Mekong Delta</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mekong Delta&nbsp;is the region in southern Vietnam where the river approaches and empties into the sea. It is a very rich and lush area, covered with rice fields, that produces about half of the total of Vietnam&rsquo;s agricultural output. Subsequently, life in the Mekong Delta revolves much around the river, and all the villages are often accessible by river rather than by road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Cu Chi Tunnels</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cu Chi Tunnels are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels located about 70km northwest of&nbsp;Ho Chi Minh City&nbsp;centre. The tunnels, measuring 200km in total length, were used by liberation soldiers as hiding spots during the Vietnam War, and were the base of operations for the Tet Offensive in 1968.

For example, you can negotiate your&nbsp;cell phone,car insurance,&nbsp;credit card interest, and&nbsp;bank fees. A one-time 5-minute call can save you every month. If you save just $25 on your cell phone bill per month (very reasonable), you&rsquo;ll cover half your morning lattes &mdash; no willpower needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STEP 2: Automate finances to make saving money painless and spending guilt-free</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason we don&rsquo;t save money is the pain of putting money into our savings accounts each month. Just like the lattes, we may do it once or twice but if we have to make the decision EVERY paycheck, we&rsquo;re setting ourselves up to fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why automated finances work so well. By setting up a bulletproof personal finance system, you can start to dominate your finances by having your system&nbsp;passively&nbsp;do the right thing for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will help you automatically manage your money, guilt-free, for years to come. Bills, payments, and savings will be automated, leaving you to focus on the things that really matter. And since the system is so flexible, you can tweak it to your specific situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3: Focus on the Big Wins, not minutiae</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason we covered that skipping lattes doesn&rsquo;t work to save money is that the amount of money you save is so small. Even $730 per year (remember if you do it every single day AND put the money aside), won&rsquo;t make a significant improvement in your quality of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I encourage you to instead focus on&nbsp;Big Wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big wins are the 5-7 actions that can significantly impact your income and your life &ndash; such as making money on the side, investing early, and negotiating a raise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beautiful part about Big Wins is you do the work up front &mdash; and they pay rewards&nbsp;for the rest of your life. For example, one $5,000 salary negotiation in your 20s can be worth over $1,000,000 over your lifetime.

Girls don&#39;t actually want to sleep with bartenders</strong><br />\r\nOk, well, some do. But the reality is that most women aren&#39;t patient enough to wait until 4:30am for their bartender-crush to close up shop, return home, down a pair of cheap beers, and catch up on their /r/cocktails Reddit feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;A bartender&#39;s &quot;favorite drink to make&quot; is what you&#39;ll most enjoy</strong><br />\r\nOrdering a bartender&#39;s signature cocktail might earn you a slight nod of approval, but usually your barkeep is much happier to make you something you&#39;re not going to regret spending eight bucks on. If you&#39;re looking for drink advice, give a few hints as to what you enjoy or ask what the bartender would be drinking if they were on the other side of the bar. Odds are they are also professional drinkers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Bartenders don&#39;t always remember a name, but they always remember a tip</strong><br />\r\nTipping well is the number one way to get a bartender on your side, but an experienced barkeep can usually tell when you&#39;re trying to buy their friendship. That won&#39;t fly. Also, a good tip isn&#39;t always just cash; it can be a good attitude, a bit of well-timed banter, or just the ability to read the wavelength of the bartender and act accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Some bartenders drink during their shift, but not all of them</strong><br />\r\nSome bars don&#39;t allow it. Some bartenders don&#39;t care about that rule. It&#39;s not uncommon for a bartender to do a few shots during a shift to take the edge off and as hospitality lubrication. But many have a general policy of not drinking with customers, and will go so far as to pour water in their own shot glass instead of vodka to maintain the illusion that they are fun party dudes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Most craft-cocktail bartenders rarely order cocktails</strong><br />\r\nThey want to make it easy on the other bartenders by just getting a beer and a shot, and not bogging someone down by making a 10-ingredient tiki drink. But if the night is slow, a bartender will usually try to order a drink that&#39;s indicative of the establishment. And always with a glass of ice water. They don&#39;t expect you to order like you&#39;re in the industry, but would appreciate it if you did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. It looks easier than it is</strong><br />\r\nOn average, bartenders probably do 10-12hr shifts, sometimes with no break. There are hours of prep work, hours of clean-up, and hours of catering to the demands of people who have no concept of a bartender&#39;s actual hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>7. Their lives are not an endless party</strong><br />\r\nThe bartender is like the parent at a slumber party: they are working to make sure everybody else is having fun, while trying to keep them from getting in too much trouble. And once the kids go to bed, they&#39;re up late cleaning the mess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/43/content_Pirate_girl_Bartender_Hi_res._touch_up.jpg\" /><br />\r\n<strong>8. When you&#39;re in an environment that&#39;s extremely high volume, </strong>everything goes out the window<br />\r\nA skilled bartender always wants to make the best drink possible, but in a busy bar there&#39;s a balance between meticulous craftsmanship and breakneck efficiency. This is particularly true of inexperienced bartenders who don&#39;t have their recipes memorized. If they&#39;re slammed with Negroni, Manhattan, and Old Fashioned orders back-to-back, they&#39;re immediately in the weeds and will be much less excited to discuss the intricacies of their tiki menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Bartending is largely about multi-tasking and quick memory recall</strong><br />\r\nBartenders do everything at once. A home-cocktail-enthusiast might be able to make a good Manhattan, but it&#39;s an entirely different thing to make three at once while taking a beer order, running a credit card, and being eye-pulled by 10 strangers. Most decent bartenders can multi-task like maniacs, good ones can do it while keeping their drinks to a high standard, and only the best can pull it off while maintaining a hospitable smile.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>10. People trust bartenders more than their therapists</strong><br />\r\nYou&#39;re not paying a bartender for their time, you&#39;re paying them for a way to waste yours. So advice from a bartender seems to come with the same air of authority as a professional counselor, but without the baggage of a ticking clock.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>11. The human interaction is what makes bartenders feel like they&#39;re people too</strong><br />\r\nYou might run into a gruff bartender who doesn&#39;t want to chat, but most are pretty outgoing people. They wouldn&#39;t be in this industry if they didn&#39;t like talking to strangers. Strangers who tip them well.</p>\r\n','bartender-resume-sample.jpg',183,'','published','2015-11-29 23:14:13',NULL,NULL,2,3,'2015-11-29 23:14:14','2016-02-26 21:53:30'),(31,' Lantern Festival in China','<p>The Lantern Festival, which occurs on the 15-th day of the First Month of the Chinese Year, marks the end of the New Year&#39;s Holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lantern Festival is the last day (traditionally) of China&#39;s most important festival, Spring Festival (春节 Chūnji&eacute; /chwn-jyeah/ a.k.a. the&nbsp;Chinese New Year&nbsp;festival).

It is the most important festival observed by the Dai ethnic people of Xishuangbanna Prefecture, and, similar to neighboring Thailand&#39;s Songkran Festival, it involves three days of celebrations that include sincere, yet light-hearted religious rituals that invariably end in merrymaking, where everyone ends up getting splashed, sprayed or doused with water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The festival lasts for three days. The first two days&#39;s activities are concentrated on the banks of the Lancang River. On the first day, a grand celebration marks the beginning of the festival.&nbsp; An out-door market is set up, where locals go for new year shopping.&nbsp; It is also a great place to purchase local &nbsp;souvenirs. Local food and snacks&nbsp;are other highlights traveler may not want to miss. Artists create sand cavings on&nbsp;open space&nbsp;close to the market. &nbsp;A&nbsp;dragon boat race&nbsp;is held on the Lancang River to ring out the old year in the afternoon.&nbsp; At night, the banks of the river&nbsp;are colorfully lit, and locals float river lanterns on the river. Floating river lanterns is an old tradition in China, which is still preserved in many cities today. The practice is thought to drive bad luck away and bring good luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/47/content_f04da2db148412d6fb1e51.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third day, the climax of the festival, is reserved for water splashing. On that day, the Dai put on their newest and best clothes, then assemble at the local Buddhist temple, where the monks chant Buddhist scriptures. Afterward, a symbolic water splashing ritual is enacted whereby a Buddhist statue, with pomp and ceremony, is first coaxed out of the temple to the courtyard, then is splashed with water. This important ritual is called &#39;Bathing the Buddha&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The completion of the &#39;Bathing the Buddha&#39; ritual serves as the signal that encourages ordinary mortals to themselves engage in mutual water splashing. Accordingly, people flock to the streets with pots, pans, bottles, or whatever, where they uninhibitedly splash, spray and douse each other with water, with the same gusto with which Westerners engage in a good snowball free-for-all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Water Splashing ceremony, however, is more than just good-natured fun; it also contains a religious element: water is regarded by the Dai as a symbol, firstly, of religious purification, but also of goodwill among people. Therefore, splashing a fellow human being with water during the Water Splashing Festival, whether a close neighbor or a fellow villager, or even a stranger, is an expression of the desire for good luck and prosperity to that person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the tourist interested in interacting directly with the Dai ethnic minority of Xishangbanna Prefecture in an informal and fun-filled manner, the annual Water Splashing Festival that takes place in the month of April is the perfect occasion.

Become knowledgeable about the competition, and understand how your company is better and worse than they are. &nbsp;Be able to articulate your understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get out of your box</strong>. If you look at what the company needs only from the perspective of your own function (HR, IT, marketing &ndash; whatever it is), you will be seen as tactical at best, and an impediment to the business&rsquo; success at worst. Step back and think about what would best serve the business overall. Speak from that vantage point. Hold yourself accountable to represent the company&rsquo;s interests (especially when they conflict with yours) and you&rsquo;ll be seen as a real asset to any organizational-level discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be useful in a big way.</strong> Talk is cheap. If you want to be seen as valuable, actually help the line business people in your organization meet their goals. Either do things in your own area that make it easier for them to do their jobs, or share ideas (based in your real understanding of the business) about how they can achieve goals more easily or quickly.&nbsp; If good things happen for the business as a result of you being involved in projects, you&rsquo;ll be invited back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Listen.</strong>&nbsp; The best way to do all three of the things I&rsquo;ve noted above is to start by really, truly listening.&nbsp; Get deeply curious.&nbsp; Summarize to make sure you&rsquo;ve understood.&nbsp; When you get new information, listen very carefully to hear how it relates to what you already know and what it says about the person who&rsquo;s speaking.&nbsp; People love to be deeply listened to &ndash; they see excellent listeners as wise, insightful and interesting. (Yes, you read that right &ndash; people see those who listen to them as being more interesting people.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s because someone who&rsquo;s interested in us is interesting to us!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, remember that reputation and influence are built over time.&nbsp; If you start behaving in these ways, you&rsquo;ll begin to be seen as a great person to have around.

But what should we do with the devices they are replacing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of our gadgets end up in landfills, others stuffed away in a closet, never to be played with again. In the tech industry, hoarding or disposing of used electronics this way is known as e-waste, and can leave&nbsp;toxic materials and pollutants&nbsp;in the environment. The amount of e-waste is growing every year &mdash; by some estimates, consumers threw away 92 billion pounds of used electronics last year, up from 87.7 billion pounds the previous year, according to a report by theUnited Nations University, the academic and research arm of the United Nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efforts are underway to dispose of electronics more responsibly. Electronics resellers, for one, have existed for years and purchase old tech products. More recently, large tech companies including Apple and phone carriers like Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile USA and AT&amp;T have begun trade-in programs&nbsp;for cellphones, offering consumers credit toward buying new phones. The companies then often resell the old cellphones internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet the e-waste issue persists. Many people shove their old computers and tablets into junk drawers or closets, said Chris Sullivan, the chief executive of&nbsp;Gazelle, a company that buys and sells used electronics. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re unaware of the options,&rdquo; he said, on how to responsibly dispose of many electronics. &ldquo;I think people aren&rsquo;t necessarily inherently lazy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make way for tech presents this holiday season, I recently tried out three programs for getting rid of used electronics. The programs,Amazon, Gazelle and&nbsp;Best Buy, are available nationwide. Each one was simple to use and headache-free, and I even managed to get a decent amount of money for my old electronics, like my outdated video game controller and a used smartphone, to spend on holiday gifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s trade-in program&nbsp;was my favorite of the three because it accepts such a wide variety of products, from old DVDs to Wi-Fi routers, in exchange for&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;gift cards. The process starts on the program&rsquo;s website,&nbsp;amazon.com/trade-in, where you can find out which items the retailer will buy. The process took me a while, but I eventually learned that the company would buy a good amount of junk in my drawer: a PlayStation 3 controller, three used video games and two cable modems from past living situations. (Nontech items can be sold, too. I even managed to get rid of a gluten-free cookbook I bought two years ago when my girlfriend was hooked on that trendy diet.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I knew which items Amazon would take, the company supplied me with a free shipping label. All I had to do was pack everything up and drop the packages off at a U.P.S. mailbox. About two weeks later, after Amazon inspected each item, I received about $60 worth of Amazon store credit. Not shabby at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stacey Keller, an Amazon spokeswoman, said the company&rsquo;s trade-in program allowed people to declutter by selling an array of eligible items &ldquo;and in return, receive an Amazon gift card which can be spent on millions of items that they actually want.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertisement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continue reading the main story</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertisement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continue reading the main story</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also used Gazelle, which buys and sells used electronics, to sell a used iPhone. The company gave me a quote of $70 based on the &ldquo;good&rdquo; condition and age of the phone. Then it gave me the option to receive a free box with packing materials for the phone or to print out a free shipping label so I could pack and ship the phone myself. I chose the second option, erased the contents of the phone, removed the SIM card and shipped the phone in a used Amazon box. Two weeks later, after Gazelle inspected the phone, I got my $70 via PayPal, the popular payment service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gazelle sells other types of products, too. In years past, I have sold used Apple laptops and an iPad to the service and got a reasonable amount of money in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We purchase a lot more than just phones, and we get that message out as best we can,&rdquo; said Mr. Sullivan of Gazelle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take those devices.&rdquo; In the event that a product is unusable and Gazelle declines the purchase, the company offers to recycle it responsibly free through its&nbsp;partner CloudBlue, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After selling items to both Amazon and Gazelle, I was still left with plenty of e-junk. I turned to&nbsp;Best Buy, which has a&nbsp;nationwide recycling program&nbsp;that it started about six years ago. The stores invite shoppers to drop off electronics, including televisions, batteries, ink cartridges and power cables, at kiosks or the customer service desk. Best Buy says it teams up with responsible recycling companies likeElectronics Recyclers International&nbsp;and&nbsp;Regency Technologies. Most gadgets can be dropped off for recycling free at Best Buy, though some states require consumers to&nbsp;pay a small fee&nbsp;to recycle certain items, like old TVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to put the Best Buy program to the test by gathering the least desirable electronics in my home, along with some unsolicited items that have been mailed to the New York Times office in San Francisco over the last three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I packed up a DVD collection of all five &ldquo;Home Alone&rdquo; movies (who even knew there were five?), two Motorola phone cases, two styluses and a cup holder that attaches to laptops. At a Best Buy store, I laid the items on the customer service desk and described them one by one: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a collection of &lsquo;Home Alone&rsquo; DVDs that nobody will ever want, a useless cup holder, some lame styluses and some Motorola cases,&rdquo; I said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Best Buy employee laughed and thanked me before placing the items in a pile. I was surprised she didn&rsquo;t ask me to pay the store to take the junk away from me. Now I&rsquo;m e-waste-free and ready for some new gear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sourcce:nytimes.com</p>\r\n','03techfix-illo-master675.jpg',126,'','published','2015-12-03 08:48:54',NULL,NULL,4,3,'2015-12-03 08:48:54','2016-02-26 13:58:27'),(37,'How to Handle a Telephone Screening Interview','<p>Position postings on major internet job boards tend to generate a large volume of resumes. Once your resume has made it past the first sort it&#39;s likely you&#39;ll receive a phone call. The purpose of this call is to determine whether you meet the minimum position requirements. The caller wants to make sure a face-to-face meeting is a good use of time for everyone. The caller is looking for specific job related information and is also making judgments about job related personal characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gather your reference materials together and keep them close.&nbsp;- These materials include a copy of your resume, a copy of each job posting or ad to which you&#39;ve applied and your research notes about the company. Since it&#39;s a phone call you can easily refer to these things without the caller being aware of what you&#39;re doing.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be prepared to discuss why you&#39;re currently looking for work;&nbsp;what skills you have that meet the position requirements; and whether your pay requirements fall within the hiring range. There may also be questions relating to your job stability or why you changed from job to job.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Take a short moment to collect yourself before launching into the conversation.&nbsp;The call will generally be made during business hours and may take you by surprise. If that happens ask the caller to hold for a moment while you move to a quiet location. Or ask if you may call the person &#39;right back&#39;. It is also acceptable to let the call go to voice mail. That will give you time to prepare for the call.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write down the caller&#39;s name and use it.&nbsp;Use Mr. and Ms. Don&#39;t call the person by her first name unless invited to do so.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Know what the caller&#39;s role is within the hiring process.&nbsp;You need to know who you&#39;re dealing with. If you can&#39;t tell by the caller&#39;s title ask if she&#39;s &quot;the hiring manager&quot;. If she isn&#39;t she&#39;ll be flattered and if she is...good!

Whether you&rsquo;re looking to book the trip of a lifetime, a short break or a gap year adventure, it&rsquo;s hard not to be overwhelmed by the range of options and destinations on offer. Here are our top tips for finding the right group tour for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Keep your mind open to different destinations</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It can be tempting to hone in on the best-known and most popular destinations, but it&rsquo;s worth exploring further &ndash; especially if you&rsquo;re planning your trip around a specific activity. Did you know that you can take a cycling tour in Cuba, discover pristine islands off the coast of Panama, try mountain biking in Kazakhstan and help wildlife conservation efforts in Nepal? Group tours also give you more security than travelling independently, so you can feel safe venturing off the beaten track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Think about how much you want to pack in</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consider what you want to get out of your trip. Do you want to get a taste of several countries or would you rather spend longer getting under the skin of one place? How hectic do you want your itinerary to be? There&rsquo;s a tour out there for everyone &ndash; and no right or wrong way to travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Be realistic</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, that 12-day trek might sound incredible, but if you&rsquo;ve spent the last two years sitting at a desk all day you&rsquo;ll need to think seriously about preparation. Similarly three days on a camel in the Moroccan desert might make for some awesome photos, but if you melt in the heat, it could end up being slightly more challenging than you expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Always book with a trusted operator</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Make sure you book your trip with a reliable, trusted operator. Using a service like TourRadar makes this simple and hassle-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5. Check what&rsquo;s included</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The prices for most tours don&rsquo;t include flights and on many you&rsquo;ll need to pay for at least some of your meals. These extra costs can mount up, so take them into consideration early on and don&rsquo;t leave flight booking to the last minute. You&rsquo;ll also need to make sure you&rsquo;re fully insured &ndash; especially if you&rsquo;re planning to try your hand at adventure sports while you&rsquo;re away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6. Read the reviews</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Worried you won&rsquo;t be up to that hike? Want to know what the food&rsquo;s going to be like? More often than not, you&rsquo;ll find previous travellers have answered these questions in the reviews. There&rsquo;s no better way to get an idea of what the trip&rsquo;s going to be like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>source:&nbsp;roughguides</p>\r\n','136978634958.jpg',86,'','published','2015-12-04 06:58:03',NULL,NULL,3,3,'2015-12-04 06:58:04','2016-02-26 13:58:14'),(39,'2016 Rolls-Royce Wraith deftly blends modern technology (Video inside)','<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/54/content_0606b30a778e15d1bdb8d215554186c0.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2016 Rolls-Royce Wraith deftly blends modern technology with traditional craftsmanship in a stylish coupe that makes no excuses for its lavish excess. All of this performance and luxury doesn&#39;t come cheaply, though: Options can easily add tens of thousands of dollars to a base price around $300,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just over a decade ago designer&nbsp;Marek&nbsp;Djordjevic established a new design vocabulary for Rolls-Royce, and the Wraith shares its elegantly muscular look with stablemates like the Ghost sedan and forthcoming Dawn convertible. It&#39;s defined by rectangular headlights on either side of a simple-but-bold grille, slab sides, and a bluff, neatly sculpted tail. The design lends itself to the two-tone paint schemes used by Rolls-Royce for most of its history.&nbsp;There isn&#39;t much precedent, however, for the Wraith&#39;s fastback styling -- sportier coachwork usually graced Bentleys -- but the retro-inspired slope looks good from most angles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rear-hinged doors (Rolls-Royce understandably calls these &quot;coach&quot; rather than &quot;suicide&quot;) also give a nod to the past, but add the functional purpose of aiding more dignified entry and exit. While the Wraith&#39;s length stretches past 17 feet, excellent proportions mask its actual size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rolls-Royce has always turned out top-notch interiors, and the Wraith doesn&#39;t disappoint. Rich, soft leather, finely crafted woods, and machined metal trim elements surround occupants in all four seats. Buyers who are willing to wait for a special order can ask for almost anything, even if it&#39;s not on an option list that already includes plenty of&nbsp;outr&eacute;&nbsp;features like a fiber-optic light system that mimics a star-filled night sky. Those who prefer to gaze at the real stars may specific a fixed glass roof with a leather sun blind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the Ghost, the Wraith is built on a variant of the BMW 7-Series platform, but this relationship won&#39;t be apparent to most drivers or observers. A 6.6-liter twin-turbo V-12 rated at 624 horsepower propels all 5,203 pounds of the Wraith to 60 mph in a swift 4.4 seconds, according to Rolls-Royce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/53/content_2014-Rolls-Royce-Wraith-rear-1.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>quicker than the Ghost.) And a Wraith will charge all the way up to an electronically-limited top speed of 155 mph. An innovative ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic transmission uses GPS and terrain data to pre-select ideal gears for smoother performance through sharp turns, hills, and dales. Twenty-inch wheels are standard, while 21-inchers are optional. A stately ride quality is as much a Rolls-Royce trait as the Spirit of Ecstasy on the car&#39;s bonnet, and it&#39;s achieved in the Wraith with an electronically controlled air suspension. This all contributes to the dynamic &quot;waftability&quot; that Rolls-Royce wants to achieve in its cars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s more fuel-efficient than the larger Phantom Coup&eacute;, but the Wraith can&#39;t escape its significant avoirdupois or massively potent engine. The EPA estimates gas mileage at 15 mpg combined (13 mpg in the city and 21 highway).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crash safety is untested, but here, the mass of the Wraith works in its favor, as does Rolls-Royce&#39;s very solid construction and inclusion of standard safety equipment like force-limiting seat belts, smart airbags that adjust to occupant size, and the Advanced Crash Management system, which uses sensors within the car to take 2,000 measurements per second, and, in the event of an accident, to deploy the appropriate pre-emptive safety measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, if you have to ask, you can&#39;t afford it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/56/content_2016-Rolls-Royce-Phantom-Serenity-interior.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/55/content_2014-rolls-royce-wraith_100444688_m.jpg\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/57/content_img_7224.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>==&gt;&gt;Visit video below:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bcZ_Z8aHccc\"></iframe></div>\r\n','rolls-royce-wraith-3.jpg',174,'','published','2015-12-05 05:42:26',NULL,NULL,4,4,'2015-12-05 05:32:59','2016-02-26 13:58:08'),(40,'How to Kiss a Women','<p>Here is what great consensual kissing is really about. Please share this list widely. I want all you kissers to feel elated with the kind of action that brings a smile to your lips when you remember&nbsp;that kiss, even years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Great kissers show up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you heard me. It means you are in room, here, now, with me. Not in your head, and not just in your gonads either. Your full presence takes ordinary lip lust to a new intimate dimension. When your are&nbsp;present with a woman sensually, time slows down, it even seems to stop. (It seems the women I&rsquo;ve kissed seem to know this instinctively.) And when you are present, you notice things, like how she is responding (or not). Bottomline: there is no better place to be than here and now in both heart and body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Great kissers tease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s fun to bypass the kissing warm up. But most times it&rsquo;s exquisite to have your lips brush against the back of my neck (chills) or trail along my collarbone before working their way up to the main event. This is called playful seduction. It works. And it&rsquo;s fun for both of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Great kissers use their hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kissing is only one instrument in the symphony of sensual connection. Your hands can be a beautiful accompaniment&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean groping. Rather, hold my face in your hands while you kiss me, or stroke or even gently pull my hair. Find ways to make the kiss a part of the music, not the whole song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Great kissers make eye contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know this already. It&rsquo;s not about that new-age-movement eye-gazing&nbsp;contest where the longer you stare without looking away, the more spiritually evolved you are. It&rsquo;s about every now and then pulling back from the kiss to look at me. I might be just as shy as you, but when your eyes meet mine, the thrill of vulnerability is worth the risk. And it ignites passion. Try it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Great kissers don&rsquo;t have a destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means I don&rsquo;t feel like the kissing part is something you are doing to get points on the way to the next base. In fact, one of my most memorable first dates ended up in a two hour kissing marathon on his sofa&mdash;that was the most turned on I have ever been fully clothed! This is a bit about being in the moment, again, but it&rsquo;s also about intention. If feels different to a woman if you are languorously kissing her for the sheer mutual pleasure of it versus kissing her on a mad dash to get to the penetrative sex finish line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Great kissers take risks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not talking about the creepy lunge-kiss, the kind of move where you completely freak out an unsuspecting woman with your lips. I am talking about those spontaneous kisses you surprise us&mdash;your girlfriend, wife, or more-than-first-date woman&mdash;with. Those stolen kisses just before we walk arm-in-arm into a party where we both feel a bit nervous. Or that kiss when the kids are not looking. Or hey, the kiss in the green room before I head off to my appearance on some TV show. You know, those kisses where I feel we are a naughty team and you have so-got-my-back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Great kissers receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means you are not always running the show. Guys tend to take the lead when it comes to kissing, sometimes inadvertently over-ruling their partner&rsquo;s natural inclination to kiss back. Slow down and don&rsquo;t kiss&mdash;see what happens when you allow us to love you back. Give her some room to play with your lips too. You will be delighted at the interplay of kissing and being kissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now for one of my favourite all time kissing songs, Kiss Me Forever, by Julian Dore.

Either way, the person is giving you feedback after interviewing you - this is a golden opportunity to get a potential employer&#39;s assessment of your strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listen for the &quot;kiss of death.&quot;&nbsp;If the interviewer says something like &quot;don&#39;t take it as a blow if you don&#39;t get this job,&quot; it&#39;s likely that you should keep on looking.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Watch for signs of discomfort and dishonesty.&nbsp;If the interviewer wipes their palms on their suit before shaking hands, the interviewer may be nervous, too. This could be a sign of dishonesty - or the person might just be hot and uncomfortable. By this time, you should have a good idea which applies.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ask!&nbsp;If you can&#39;t read the interviewer at the end of the interview, work up your courage, smile, and look him in the eye, and ask directly: &quot;I appreciate your taking the time to interview me. How did I do?&quot; The interviewer&#39;s face will probably reveal the answer. Don&#39;t press too hard, and be gracious whether the news is good or bad.</p>\r\n','in.jpg',147,'','published','2015-12-12 01:14:18',NULL,NULL,2,3,'2015-12-12 01:14:19','2016-02-26 13:58:15'),(43,'Top 5 upcoming smartwatches in 2016( video Inside)','<p>In this video, We will show you our top 5 best upcoming Smartwatches in 2016.

First on our list is the Bamboo Island Beach. Located in Southern Thailand and protected by cliffs of limestone that tame the waves, the fantastic Bamboo Island is a remote tropical paradise of white sand and shimmering turquoise-colored waters. It is near the bustling Maya Bay, where the Leonardo DiCaprio starrer, The Beach, was filmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located in Phuket, the natural beauty of Bamboo Island Beach is protected thanks to its status of National Park. Besides enjoying the sun and the sand on Thailand&rsquo;s most visited beach, it is also a hotspot for snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, swimming, feeding the fish and other recreational water activities. There are only two seasons on the Island &ndash; the hot season and the rainy season. Vacationers will want to be sure to visit between January and April, which is the Island&rsquo;s hot season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For accommodations, hotel stays are more expensive and the price gets higher for beach front rooms. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean Bamboo Island Beach isn&rsquo;t backpackers-friendly. In fact, there are a lot of little dorms and hostels across the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/58/content_DSC08696.jpg\" /></p>\r\n','trip-store-krabi-day.jpg',79,'','published','2015-12-16 09:43:31',NULL,NULL,3,3,'2015-12-16 09:43:31','2016-02-25 04:10:10'),(45,'Thaipusam Festival (India)','<p>During the Thai month (January/February) the Tamil community celebrates the Thaipusam festival on the full moon. This Hindu festival is famous in India, but also observed in countries such as Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar. The festival&rsquo;s name is a combination of the month when it occurs (Thai) and the name of a star that is at its highest point during the festival (Pusam).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While spectators can expect the traditional bright colors and loud drums during the festival, they are also in for a cringe-worthy scene as participants of the festival parade while being heavily pierced.&nbsp;This painful practice is a sign of devotion to the Hindu god of war, Lord Murugan who is being commemorated during the festival. The festival highlights the moment when Parvati gave Murugan a &ldquo;Vel&rdquo; (spear) to vanquish the evil demon Soorapadman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The devotees go in public processions while carrying pots of milk on their heads as a token for Lord Murugan and piercing different parts of their bodies while doing the&nbsp;kavadidance. You will see some with piercings through their cheeks, dancers with hooks on their backs, and other devotees with a spear pricked through their cheeks. You can imagine just how much pain they go through, but devotees claim they feel no pain as they enter a trance-like state that elevates them from physical discomfort. You would see no blood from their piercings. The wounds also heal perfectly with no scars appearing after. This festival is definitely not for the faint-hearted.</p>\r\n','big-02-618x412.jpg',65,'','published','2015-12-16 10:02:19',NULL,NULL,5,3,'2015-12-16 10:02:19','2016-02-25 04:10:11'),(46,'How to Understand Why You Didn\'t Get a Job','<p>Finding a job can be stressful and time consuming, especially when you&#39;re going through the interview process. Therefore, it is understandable to feel upset when you find out you did not get the job you were hoping for. While you cannot change the employer&rsquo;s mind, you can try to understand why you did not get the job, gain some constructive criticism and work to improve your chances for the next job that comes around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 1 of 2: Getting Over the Initial Feeling of Rejection<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stay calm when hearing the news.&nbsp;After hearing you did not get the job, you may feel angry or upset. It may be tough, but letting your emotions get the best of you will not help you understand why you didn&rsquo;t get the job. It will also not help you learn what you should do when you apply for other jobs.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are speaking to the employer over the phone, it may also be a turnoff if you start crying or yelling.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember you may not have gotten this job but you could be right for another job with this company in the future. So stay calm and professional.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try not to take the rejection personally.&nbsp;There are many factors that contribute to choosing the right person to hire. Yes, some of it may depend on personal traits such as approachability and personality but for the most part it comes down to who can do the job the best amongst the pool of candidate.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is why it is important to probe further as to why you were not chosen for the job.&nbsp;There is no sense in getting upset thinking they just didn&rsquo;t like you when it probably just came down to the fact that the other person had specific experience that you did not.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Understand that your rejection has more to do with the other people interviewed, and less to do with your skills and experience.&nbsp;As previously mentioned, your chances of getting the job depends on who else is interviewing for that same job. If there are multiple good candidates for the job, the employer must then make a tough decision.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember that you may have gotten the job if the other candidates did not interview so well. You may just have a few years less experience than the person who was offered the job or maybe the employer knows that they can get the other person to do the job for less money than you would.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever the case may be, understand it is not always personal but just the luck of who is in the candidate pool and what they have to offer. Remember, you have no control over who else applies for the job.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPart 2 of 2: Seeking Ways to Improve Your Chances Next Time<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ask questions regarding what the employer was looking for.&nbsp;It is important to know where you stacked up against the other candidates, or more importantly, how you compared to the person who was offered the job. Think about asking the following questions to understand why you were not chosen and what exactly the employer was looking for:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you give me a particular reason why I was not chosen for this job?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What experience or abilities were you looking for that you felt I lack?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Did you feel I would have fit in to your company culture?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Were there any other factors besides my experience and abilities that prevented me from getting this job?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ask for constructive criticism.&nbsp;If you handle taking some constructive criticism, it could prove very helpful for you in future. The recruiter or hiring manager understands your experience and has seen how you interview. There is always room for improvement in this area, even for experienced interviewees. Think about asking for constructive criticism on the following:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Applying for the right position. Should you continue to apply for this type of position with other companies? Do you have what it takes? For example, if you are applying for a director level position with only 3 years of management experience. At this point should you be looking for another management position or keep trying for director level?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Communication Skills. Can you properly communicate ideas and the extent of your experience in an interview?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Answering tough questions. Sometimes it is hard to answer questions about yourself. Do you just need some practice?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Listen attentively and take notes.&nbsp;If you have asked the questions stated above, you should make the effort to listen carefully to the answers. Staying quiet and listening to what they have to say is important and will help you in the future. Take notes based on their constructive criticism so you can refer back to these notes before applying for or interviewing for the next job that comes along.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Address any issues or suggestions moving forward.&nbsp;Although you are not guaranteed to get the next job you apply or even interview for, working on areas of improvement will reduce your chances of future rejection.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Think back to your conversation with the employer and look at any notes you have taken. Then, find ways to improve your skills based on the constructive criticism given.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, if lack of eye contact was an issue, work on your ability to hold conversations while maintaining constant eye contact.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let this rejection reduce your confidence.&nbsp;The more times you get rejected, the more your confidence will be reduced. It is understandable that every time you hear the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; you start losing hope. Deal with the rejection in the best way by learning from the experience. This will increase your chances of getting the job next time.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, each &ldquo;no&rdquo; will bring you closer to a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; so long as you learn from your experience and do not give up. There is a job out there for you so long as you keep looking.</p>\r\n','depositphotos_29703739-Businessman-tired-from-crisis-and-working-with-hands-over-face.jpg',48,'','published','2016-01-16 23:56:33',NULL,NULL,2,3,'2016-01-16 23:56:33','2016-02-25 04:10:10'),(47,'How to Avoid Asking Bad Interview Questions','<p>Coming up with good interview questions can be tricky for both the interviewer and the interviewee. No matter which side of the interview you&#39;re on, it&#39;s important that you do your homework to ensure that you get the most out of your questions and avoid asking the wrong things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Method 1 of 2: As an Interviewer<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set hiring goals. Most recruiters are not clear about their hiring goals.&nbsp;Being a part of the selection team, you must know what the hiring goals are or what is the purpose of hiring?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recruiters mostly ask irrelevant questions during an interview just because of lack of information. They are themselves not clear about their job. In other words, they do not really know what they should ask to judge candidate skills.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is why it&#39;s so important to set hiring goals before starting the interview process Create a one page document that mentions the things you are looking for in the candidate or the things you won&rsquo;t compromise upon while making a hiring decision.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, your hiring goal can be to find a marketing manager, aged above 40 having extraordinary communication skills and past experience of serving in a medium or large organization.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Familiarize yourself with the relevant job duties.&nbsp;Another common reason recruiters ask bad interview questions that are totally irrelevant to the job is their lack of knowledge regarding the job posts being filled.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no logic checking leadership skills while hiring a sales worker or checking communication skills while hiring an I.T. expert. You should know the job duties for the relevant post so that you may ask questions accordingly.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is recommended that you read the job description before taking the interview. Create a one page document mentioning the key job responsibilities, then ask questions on the basis of job duties instead of asking random questions<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Create a checklist of questions to be asked.&nbsp;It is better to create a checklist of all the questions to be asked beforehand in order to avoid asking bad interview questions. If you are new in the recruitment team then this tip is especially for you.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Creating a checklist does not mean that you have to strictly follow it. You may also ask any other question that comes in your mind at the time of taking the interview. The purpose of creating checklist is just to remain focused.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Read the job description and check hiring goals while making checklist, or get a checklist made from an experienced recruiter. Double check the questions to ask to make sure that all of them are relevant to the job.<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remain as unbiased as possible.&nbsp;It is very important for recruiters to put aside their personal preferences and biases when giving interviews.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Asking confusing, irrelevant and difficult questions from candidate just because he or she is a certain rare, religion or gender is neither logical nor ethical.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t let your personal feelings affect the interview process and educate yourself about possible biases you have to avoid. Set the same standards for everyone irrespective of their age, gender, race, ethnicity etc.<br />\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stop when you get tired.&nbsp;Many recruitment teams interview hundreds of people in one day from early morning till evening. This is not a good practice as it may affect the hiring decision.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recruiters are so tired sometimes that they start asking strange questions that are in no way relevant to the job post. You must stop the interview process after you get tired in order to avoid this issue.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Take a short break after conducting every few interviews in order to regain your energy and grab a coffee to stay fresh.<br />\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Analyze each question before you ask it.&nbsp;There are a few questions you must ask yourself about every single question on your list. You will automatically avoid asking bad interview questions after giving answers to following questions:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does this question provide me with useful and relevant information about the candidate?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does this question help me in judging the skills and abilities of the candidate?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this question worth asking?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this question relevant to the job?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this question logical and practical?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it necessary to ask this question necessary for taking<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this question ethical and professional?<br />\r\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Read some examples of good interview questions.&nbsp;Some good interview questions include:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell me about any work experience relevant to this current job.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why did you leave your last job?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you work under pressure?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Why do you think you are a perfect fit for this job<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Give three reasons why we should we hire you?<br />\r\n8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stay away from bad interview questions.&nbsp;You should never ask questions such as the following:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Briefly tell me about your family.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is your current body weight?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you plan to start a family?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you ever been arrested?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Have you ever taken any drugs?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMethod 2 of 2: As an Interviewee<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Understand the importance of asking good questions.&nbsp;As a smart candidate, you should be able to make the best out of the opportunities the interviewer presents and build an insight about the company and whether the job is the right one for you.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore, the questions that you ask must be intelligent, well-thought out and pertinent. Your questions should demonstrate your attitude, your interest in the job or company as well as your work ethic.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you ask the wrong questions, you stand the risk of being judged as the wrong fit for the job. When you do not ask any questions, the interviewer may form an opinion that you are not interested in the job.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify the possible reasons for not asking any question.&nbsp;There may be a valid reason why a candidate does not ask a question when they are given this opportunity by the interviewer. However, you should still try to avoid or overcome these reasons:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#39;re caught off guard by the request for questions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You feel like you already have the information you need.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You&#39;re afraid to seem like a nuisance.<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Know the benefits of asking the right questions.&nbsp;The questions that you ask during an interview process can affect you positively. Some of the key benefits that you derive from asking the right questions during an interview are:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You can find out whether this is the right company for you or not.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you ask smart questions the interviewers know that you have prepared for the job and are serious about taking it up.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It shows off your ability to sell your skills.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The right questions not only talk about your abilities but also help you direct the interview towards the areas you are happy about.<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid asking about possible promotions.&nbsp;This can be an instant put off. Remember promotions are a dynamic situation, and there will need to be a lot of effort on your part to make them happen.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not the amount of time you spend in a certain job that will determine your career progression, but rather how well you can handle your current responsibilities and show your potential for handling bigger responsibilities will determine your career progression in any organization.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Therefore rather than asking when you will be promoted, the question can be rephrased to ask about what qualities you will need to display to achieve this.<br />\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#39;t ask any questions about salary.&nbsp;Another area that is best avoided is the question of salary. This often disappoints the interviewer.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This topic is best avoided in the initial rounds of interviews, and you should focus more on convincing the interviewer about your suitability to the role.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Along with the salary levels for the role, avoid the temptation to ask about salary raises at this stage, as this can be a touchy topic, especially depending on the financial status of the company.<br />\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stay away from questions about flextime and telecommuting.&nbsp;These two areas are also best avoided during an interview as they tell the interviewer about your eagerness to get out of the office before you&rsquo;ve even stepped in.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The interviewer may wonder if you are interested in the job at all. Therefore save it for some appropriate time later on.<br />\r\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#39;t ask obvious questions about the company.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s best not to ask about any generic business information that you could easily have found on the internet or on the company&rsquo;s website. This suggests that you did not bother to find out about the company, which shows lack of interest.<br />\r\n8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid asking any questions that give away poor listening skills.&nbsp;Be attentive during the interview so that you do not miss out on any important facts that are discussed. If you end up asking questions that might have already been discussed, shows disinterest and can prove catastrophic.<br />\r\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Follow some tips for asking the right questions. You can keep your questions on the right track by adhering to the following tips:<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Know that open-ended questions are the best: These begin with &lsquo;how,&rsquo; &lsquo;when&rsquo; and who&rsquo; and give opportunities for meaningful conversation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid confrontational questions: Any question that starts with why may sound like a challenge or confrontation and can put the interviewer in defensive mode. It is a good idea to rephrase the question to &quot;how&quot;.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid long and confusing questions: When there are too many points to a question, you may lose the essence.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid obvious questions: Do not ask for information that is readily available in the public domain, these will not show you in a good light and will highlight your lack of preparation.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Avoid manipulative or leading questions: These questions can make the interviewer feel cornered and give a bad impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n','woman-working-on-computer-at-home.jpg',57,'','published','2016-01-17 00:00:47',NULL,NULL,2,3,'2016-01-17 00:00:47','2016-02-25 16:10:23');
